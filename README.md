|| This is a repository i made for doing apriltags, anyone collaborating in the repository can branch their code as much as they want ||

|| I changed the code to c++ again because it was the only thing on the document that i could undertand because the java code was like 10% finished and im only decent at java and the python would have been slow if we used it so i just did the c++ and fixed some things that werent there which would finish the code  btw im pretty sure i finished it we just gotta test it||
